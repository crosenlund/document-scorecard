// Gulp sets the includePaths for SASS to match all of the
// dependency folders loaded from JSPM.  So here all we have
// to do is point to the files inside those libraries.


// Start with a Reset

@import "jspm:foundation/scss/normalize";

// Load SPS style settings

@import "settings";

// Foundation 5.x

@import "jspm:foundation/scss/foundation";
@import "vendor/foundation/sps-foundation";
@import "vendor/foundation/animations";

// Font Awesome (files from CDN)

$fa-font-path: "//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/fonts";
