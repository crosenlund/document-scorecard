<h1>Bendless Love</h1>
<ui-view>

    <p>Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</p>
    <h2>A Head in the Polls</h2>
    <p>It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Why would I want to know that? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Really?!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</li>
        <li>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Day The Earth Stood Stupid</h3>

    <h4>Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?</h4>
    <p>She also liked to shut up! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</p>
