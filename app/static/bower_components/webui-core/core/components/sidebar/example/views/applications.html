<h1>Revenge of the Sith</h1>
<p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<h2>Revenge of the Sith</h2>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
    <li>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<h4>The Sith Lords</h4>
<p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. <a href ui-sref="applications.preferences">The Force is strong with this one.</a> I have you now. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
