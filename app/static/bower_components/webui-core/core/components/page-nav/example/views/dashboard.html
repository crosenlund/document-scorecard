<p>Well, we did do the nose. Well, I got better. He hasn't got shit all over him. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Why?</p>

<p>Shut up! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, how'd you become king, then? What do you mean? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.</p>

<p>I dunno. Must be a king. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
